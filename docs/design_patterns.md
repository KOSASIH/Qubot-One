# Design Patterns Used in Qubot-One

This document outlines the design patterns implemented in the Qubot-One project. These patterns help in maintaining code quality, scalability, and ease of understanding.

## 1. Model-View-Controller (MVC)

The MVC pattern is used to separate the application logic into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic. It is responsible for managing the data, including retrieving and storing it.
- **View**: The user interface that displays the data to the user and sends user commands to the controller.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It processes user input, interacts with the model, and updates the view accordingly.

## 2. Singleton

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is particularly useful for managing shared resources, such as configuration settings or logging services.

## 3. Observer

The Observer pattern is used to create a subscription mechanism to allow multiple objects to listen and react to events or changes in another object. This is useful for implementing event-driven architectures, where components need to respond to state changes.

## 4. Factory Method

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is used in Qubot-One to create different types of Qubots based on specific configurations or requirements.

## 5. Strategy

The Strategy pattern enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. In Qubot-One, this pattern is used to allow the Qubot to choose different AI algorithms based on the task it needs to perform.

## Conclusion

By utilizing these design patterns, Qubot-One achieves a modular and maintainable codebase. Understanding these patterns will help developers contribute effectively to the project and enhance its capabilities.
