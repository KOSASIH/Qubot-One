# Advanced Features of Qubot-One

This guide covers some of the advanced features of Qubot-One that can enhance your experience and allow for more complex interactions.

## 1. Customizing Qubot Behavior

### 1.1. Configuration Files

You can customize the behavior of your Qubots by modifying the configuration files. These files allow you to set parameters such as:

- **AI Algorithms**: Choose different AI algorithms for decision-making.
- **Sensor Settings**: Configure sensor thresholds and data collection intervals.

### 1.2. Scripting

Qubot-One supports scripting to automate tasks. You can write scripts in Python to define custom behaviors for your Qubots. Place your scripts in the `scripts/` directory and reference them in the Qubot configuration.

## 2. Integrating External APIs

Qubot-One can integrate with external APIs to enhance its functionality. For example, you can connect to weather APIs to allow your Qubots to make decisions based on environmental conditions.

### Example Integration

1. **Obtain API Key**: Sign up for an external API service and obtain an API key.
2. **Modify Configuration**: Update your Qubot configuration to include the API key and endpoint.
3. **Use in Scripts**: Call the API in your scripts to fetch data and make decisions.

## 3. Advanced Monitoring and Analytics

Qubot-One provides advanced monitoring and analytics features to help you track performance and optimize operations.

### 3.1. Performance Metrics

Access performance metrics through the user interface. Metrics include:

- **Response Time**: Measure how quickly your Qubots respond to commands.
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU and memory usage.

### 3.2. Logging

Enable detailed logging to capture events and errors. Configure logging settings in the `config.yaml` file to specify log levels and output formats.

## 4. Multi-Qubot Coordination

Qubot-One supports coordination between multiple Qubots for complex tasks. You can define roles and responsibilities for each Qubot in a multi-Qubot setup.

### Example Coordination

1. **Define Roles**: Specify roles for each Qubot in the configuration file.
2. **Task Assignment**: Use the user interface to assign tasks to specific Qubots based on their roles.
3. **Monitor Coordination**: Track the progress of tasks and the interaction between Qubots through the monitoring dashboard.

## Conclusion

With these advanced features, you can take full advantage of Qubot-One's capabilities. Explore the possibilities of customization, integration, and coordination to enhance your projects further.
